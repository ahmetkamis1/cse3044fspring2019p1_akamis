 ## 1)
 ### petsurfer.com
 Petsurfer is a platform that brings together pet owners and pet sitters.
 if you have a pet, you can contact the pet sitters in your city with this system.You must pay some money to this website, 
 before receive service.
 ### hostmypet.fi
 Actually hostmypet.fi is not too different from petsurfer.com but their website is more user friendly from the petsurfer as I see.
 
 So one of the difference between our system and this systems is we will work with pet sitters who don't want money.Another is about rating sitters by pet owners and also rating pet owners by pet sitters.
 ## 2)
 We want to use incremental model because of returning early phase is easy and also modifications are easy too.
 We will talk with pet owners and pet sitters every time and we will need go back to previous phases and modificate everything.
